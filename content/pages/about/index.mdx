### About
Neko is the Japanese word for cat. This is a special gallery dedicated to all my beautiful cats.
Cats are truly one of a kind and I love each and everyone of them.

* Oliver - Exotic Shorthair (Shorthair Persian)
* Victoria - Kinkalow (American Curl x Munchkin)
* Olivia - Napoleon (Exotic Shorthair x Munchkin)
* MiTu - American Domestic

If you need a little more guilty pleasure, do check out a circa 2016 Instagram account. 

Enjoy all these cuteness!

Cheers!
