Oliver (I called him Olly) is a blue point Exotic Shorthair. I got him from a breeder when he was six months old.

As he was growing older, I couldn't give him all the attention he needed due to busy work schedule and constant travel.
I offered him for adoption to a loving family when he was three years old. He has since been spoiled dearly.

He will always be the most adorable cat to me.
