MiTu is a beautiful black and white Domestic Shorthair. 

My partner got her when she was 6 years old. 
She has been living with her sisters, Olivia and Victoria, for 3 years now but she is still very timid around them.
Mitu loves to chill in the sun or inside a cozy closet. She is a loner by nature by does love her humans a lot.
