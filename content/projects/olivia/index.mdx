Olivia is a flame point Napoleon Munchkin with gorgeous blue eyes. I got her when she was 8 years old with her sister Victoria. She is now 13 years old and still pretty active.

She is very much like a British cat with. She comes and goes as she likes and usually will follow me everywhere. Oh, she also likes to eat. 

I bet she will make a great girlfriend to Garfield.
