Victoria is rare breed Munchkin known as Kinkalow. She turned 15 years old this year but she is only 7 pounds. 
I got her with her sister, Olivia, when she was 11 years old. Victoria is like the Queen, she looks very precious and regal everywhere she goes. 

At first, she was very nervous around me. But lately, she is turning into a cuddle monster. In a way, I feel like I have a forever kitten.
